        <h3>Field Procedure of Traverse Surveying</h3>
            <p>Traverse surveying involves determining the relative positions of points by measuring distances and angles between them. Here‚Äôs the stepwise process of traverse surveying</p> 
    
    <div>  <details><summary>Planning:</summary>  Planning is done in office.The feasibility of traverse network or frame assessment can be
        done in available topographical map or Google Map.Position of station is marked: must be intervisible.
        Mainly four resources are also considered.
        <ul><li>Human resources: Number of surveyor, Support Staff, team
            leader etc.</li>
        <li>Instrumental resource: Used instruments ( for angular and
            linear measurement)</li>
        <li>Economical resource: Cost and Budget</li>
        <li>Others infrastructure: Camping environment,
            Transportation access, Material access etc.</li></ul></div></details>
    
      <details><summary>Reconnaissance</summary>
            This is a first field operation and prominent stage
            Entire field is fully inspected, during inspection minor
                instrument such as abney level, Compass, Pedometer etc
                can be used.Position of all station is marked in ground. If any
                obstruction or difficulty persist, then position may be
                changed from the planned position.
                During Reconnaissance following points to be
       
                consider while selection of station.
                <ul><li>Intervisibility between two stations.</li>
                <li>Station should have at stable ground such as rocks,
                    harden soil, to avoid disaster</li>
                <li>Station should not be near the root of tree, river side,
                    land slide area.</li>
                <li>Traverse leg should be as longer as possible, shorter
                    leg produce bisection error in angle. Ratio between
                    longest leg and shortest leg in a particular traverse
                    must be within 2:1</li>
                <li>For initiation of traverse,one known point and bearing of initial line is necessary
                    or two known coordinate at initial station is necessary</li></ul> 
                </ul></details>
                <details><summary>Monumentation</summary>
                The marking of selected station on the ground
                permanently is called monumentation.It is to be done very accurately and carefully .
                Generally one or two marks are used in traverse
                station.
            
                </details>
            <details><summary>D-card preparation</summary>
                After monumentation D-card is prepared for every station.It just an identity card of the station.
                 which helps to relocate or find the
                station in the entire area.The information of D-card must be complete and clear so it
                can read easily.Information like grid sheet no, station name and number,
                type of monument and its diagram, field sketch, location(
                district, VDC, ward), land owner, local representative,
                visible station number and name, witness marks with
                direction and dimension, sketch and description to reach
                the station.</details>
                <details><summary>Observation</summary>The four types of observations are made in
                theodolite traversing.
                <ol type="1"><li>Horizontal angle:
                Different sets of readings are made for accuracy in different order of traversing.
                <ul><li>Primary traverse----- 7 sets reading</li>
                <li>Secondary traverse----5 sets reading</li>
                <li>Tertiary traverse -------3 sets reading</li></ul>
                 Note : no of sets value= 1800/n (where, n be the no. of sets) and both face( Left and right) reading is taken.
                </li>
                <li> Vertical angle:For vertical control(height) vertical angle is taken at each
                and every station from both sides ( i.e backward and forward)</li>
                <li>Distance of leg:Only horizontal distance is used for coordinate computation.So if slope distance is measured , it is converted into horizontal
                distance.</li>
                <li>Astronomical observation:Astronomical observation can be made at starting and closing leg of traverse for angular check and control.At certain interval of station, astronomical observation
                is taken for check only.</li></ol>
                </details>
                <details><summary>Interior Angle Check</summary>Ensure the sum of interior angles fits the geometrical condition for closed traverses (sum of angles = (n-2) √ó 180¬∞ for n sides).<br></details>
                <details><summary>Computation</summary>
                Convert angles to bearings if necessary.Compute the latitudes (Northing/Southing) and departures (Easting/Westing) using trigonometric functions.</details>
        <details><summary>Adjustment</summary> Bowditch's rule are applied to distribute closing error proportionally among all lines.</details>
       
        <details><summary>Plotting</summary>The traverse are drawn based on computed coordinates.</details>
        <details><summary>Results</summary>The coordinates are used for mapping or construction purposes.</details>
